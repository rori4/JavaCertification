/*
java programming is amazing

JAVA PROGRAMMING IS AMAZING
JAVAPROGRAMMINGISAMAZING

The trim() method will delete all empty spaces before and after the string. This will not affect spaces between words. And the toUpperCase will make all the characters uppercase chars. As a result we will get "JAVA PROGRAMMING IS AMAZING".
