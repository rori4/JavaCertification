Division by 0 throws a java.lang.ArithmeticException, which is a RuntimeException. This is caught by the first catch clause because it is the first block that can handle ArithmeticException. This prints 1. Now, as the exception is already handled, control goes to finally which prints 4 and then the try/catch/finally ends and 5 is printed. Remember : finally is always executed even if try or catch return; (Except when there is System.exit() in try or catch.)
